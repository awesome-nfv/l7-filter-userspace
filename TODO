For bringing this version up to speed with the kernel version and basic sanity:

- Make child connections (FTP, IRC, etc.) work.

- Catch first packet of UDP "connections".

- Make install location configurable.

- Are ^ and $ handled sensibly?  It seems so, yet the testing suite has 
some sort of quirk about newlines.


Easy nice things to add:

- Allow configuration of what marks NO_MATCH and NO_MATCH_YET get.


Things to work on after v1.0:

- Use a more efficient scheme for matching packets with connections.

- Make a mechanism for selecting non-default patterns, such as patterns 
which are faster or more accurate than the default.
