v0.2 - 9 Jan 2007

Makefile now has dependencies and stuff.

Removed forced case insensitivity.  Implemented extended pattern files.  
Case sensitivity is now the default, but can be overridden with the 
"userspace flags" line in pattern files.

Can now select the queue number.  Configuration file is now specified 
after "-f" instead of being bare.

v0.1 - 7 Dec 2006

Initial release.  TCP and UDP mostly work. Initial UDP packets are 
missed. Not a lot of features yet.
