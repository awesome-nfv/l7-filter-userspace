This is a version of l7-filter that works in userspace instead of the 
kernel.  It is eventually intended to replace the kernel version since 
running in userspace is much safer and more flexible.  However, it in 
the early stages of development and NOT yet ready for prime time.

Full documentation is at http://l7-filter.sf.net/HOWTO-userspace 
The rest of this file is an extremely abbreviated version of the HOWTO. 
Please refer to the web version for a better guide.  Also see "man 
l7-filter" after installing.

*** Installation ***

- Run "./configure" to check for dependencies.
- Run "make".
- Run "sudo make install" or similar.

You can pass in a PREFIX to the Makefile to help it find you libraries 
or to choose a different install location.  For instance:

PREFIX=/usr/ make

looks for libraries in /usr/lib/ instead of /usr/local/lib/ and

PREFIX=/usr/ make install

installs into /usr/bin/ instead of /usr/local/bin/ .

*** Running ***

Make sure you have the ip_conntrack_netlink module loaded or compiled 
into your kernel.  Run l7-filter:

l7-filter -f configfile

See sample-l7-filter.conf for the format of the config file. Send 
traffic to it:

iptables -A FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

or similar.
