This is a version of l7-filter that works in userspace instead of the 
kernel.  It is eventually intended to replace the kernel version since 
running in userspace is much safer and more flexible.  However, it in 
the early stages of development and NOT yet ready for prime time.

Full documentation is at http://l7-filter.sf.net/HOWTO-userspace 
The rest of this file is an extremely abbreviated version of the HOWTO. 
Please refer to the web version for a better guide.  Also see "man 
l7-filter" after installing.

*** Installation ***

- Run "./configure" to check for dependencies.
- Run "make".
- Run "sudo make install" or similar.

*** Running ***

Make sure you have the ip_conntrack_netlink module loaded or compiled 
into your kernel.  Run l7-filter:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./l7-filter -f configfile

The LD_LIBRARY_PATH part may not be necessary for you.  See 
sample-l7-filter.conf for the format of the config file. Send traffic to 
it:

iptables -A FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

or similar.
