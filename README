This is a version of l7-filter that works in userspace instead of the 
kernel.  It is eventually intended to replace the kernel version since 
running in userspace is much safer and more flexible.  However, it in 
the early stages of development and NOT yet ready for prime time.

Please see http://l7-filter.sf.net/HOWTO-userspace for more 
documentation.

*** Installation ***

From ftp.netfilter.org or your distribution:
install libnfnetlink
install libnetfilter_queue
install libnetfilter_conntrack

Then run ./makeit.sh

*** Running ***

Make sure you have the ip_conntrack_netlink module loaded (or compiled 
into your kernel): 
modprobe ip_conntrack_netlink

Run l7-filter:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./l7-filter configfile

The LD_LIBRARY_PATH part may not be necessary for you.

See sample-l7-filter.conf for the format of the config file.

Send traffic to it:

iptables -A FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

or 

iptables -A FORWARD -j QUEUE
